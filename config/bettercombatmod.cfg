"bow tweaker" {
    # Config list for tweaking the base damage and the velocity of all arrows shot from specific bows.
    # 
    # The base damage of a flint arrow is 2. The final damage of a flint arrow averages ~9.
    # The velocity of a fully-charged arrow (meaning a critical, with a trail of particles) averages 3.
    # 
    # The formula the final damage of a flint arrow is   ->   (velocity * arrowBaseDamage) + rand.nextInt(velocity * arrowBaseDamage / 2) + 2   ->   (~3 * 2) + rand.nextInt(~3 * 2 / 2) + 2   ->   ~9 damage.
    # For example, if you multiplied the damage of arrows shot from a minecraft:bow by 1.5 (meaning the base damage of a flint arrow would now be 3 instead of 2) the final average of that fully-charged shot would be ~13 damage.
    # 
    # The following entry (spartanweaponry:longbow_wood ~ 2.0 ~ 1.0) would multiply the base damage of arrows shot by the longbow by 2, and have the velocity remain unchanged.
    #  This would change the damage of a fully-charged shot of a flint arrow by a longbow from ~9 damage to ~16 damage.
    # 
    # The following entry (spartanweaponry:crossbow_wood ~ 0.8 ~ 1.25) would cut the base damage of crossbow by 20%, but increase the velocity of the arrows (bolts) shot by it by 25%.
    # This would keep the damage of a fully-charged shot of a bolt by a crossbow roughly the same, however, the velocity would be greatly increased.
    # 
    # The following entry (minecraft:bow ~ 1.0 ~ 1.0) would do nothing, as neither the damage or velocity is changed (multiplier of 1 would not change the value).
    # 
    # The format for the config is  ->  modID:bowName~arrowDamageMultiplier~arrowVelocityMultiplier.
    # The maximum velocity multiplier is 1.5, anything over this value will do nothing! The reason being is that the arrow travels too fast which leads to visual anomalies.
    # If the arrows look like they are swerving off to the side, it means the velocity is too high and you'll have to lower it.
    # 
    # Longbows from SpartanWeaponry already have a velocity multiplier of 1.2, try not to increase velocity much more.
    # Crossbows from SpartanWeaponry already have a velocity multiplier of 1.5, do not increase any further!

If the arrow's damage is less than 12, the Harming effect of the arrow makes up the difference, to ensure the arrow does exactly 12♥ × 6. Therefore, an unenchanted bow cannot deal more than 12 damage using Harming (or Healing) arrows, as it can deal a maximum of 11♥ × 5.5 damage on level ground. However, if the arrow would deal more than 12 damage, the harming effect is entirely neutralized. This means that bows enchanted with Power I through Power III has a chance to not utilize the arrow at full charge, and any Power level above III never utilizes Arrows of Harming effectively at full charge when against unarmored mobs/players.
